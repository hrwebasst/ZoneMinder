# TODO

* use real init or supervisord
* update to xenial
* docker-compose for ssl with nginx proxy
* figure out if api is hardcoded for /zm*
* stop being irritated about a filesystem being used as a database
* split out db
* Look into alpine to reduce bloat and building with docker-compose then importing
